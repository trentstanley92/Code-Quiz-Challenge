# Code-Quiz-Challenge
Repository for homework assignment 04
## Description
Motivation behind this project was to create a website that would display a quiz with a button to start. When pressed the button would launch a new series of texts asking a user a question with multiple choice answers to complete. Answering correctly will move to the next question, while answering incorrectly will move to the next question but also reduce time from the timer. Solves the problem of refreshing some basic javascript knowledge through a practice quiz.
## Usage
Upon opening webpage you will have the option of either starting the quiz, or viewing the highscores. When the start button is clicked, it will start the quiz and you will answer the multiple choice questions before the timer runs out. When finished you will be able to input your initials and save to the highscore leadboard.
